## Data Structures and Algorithms Major Assignment
Data Structures and Algorithms
This project includes 12 different problems solved in C++.
Topics; Greedy Algorithm, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, and Divide and Conquer

## PROBLEMS
1. Problem 1 Greedy Algorithm
2. Problem 2 Greedy Algorithm
3. Problem 3 repeat previous Problem 2 using Dynamic Programming
4. Problem 4 Greedy Algorithm
5. Problem 5 Same Problem 4 but using Dynamic Programming
6. Problem 6 Backtracking
7. Problem 7 Backtracking
8. Problem 8 Backtracking
9. Problem 9 Backtracking
10. Problem 10 Divide and Conquer
11. Problem 11 Divide and Conquer
12. Problem 12 Divide and Conquer

## Setup
1. Clone the project: git clone ``
2. Install the C++ compiler (for example, g++), the C++ compiler environment (for example, GCC), and the necessary dependencies required for the compilation process.

## Operating Instructions
There is a separate C++ file for each problem. At the beginning of each file are instructions for solving a specific problem.

Follow these steps to resolve any problems:
1. Open the relevant C++ file.
2. Compile the file: `g++ problem1.cpp -o problem1`
3. Run the resulting executable: `./problem1`
